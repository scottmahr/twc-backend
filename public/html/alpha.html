<h2><a id=wods>Benchmark Workouts</a></h2>
<p>We'll post our benchmark workouts with a brief explanation of what we're trying to find out</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <h3><a id=emom>20 min Clean Ladder</a></h3>
        <p>
            <b>On the top of every <i>other </i>minute, perform a single clean. Start at 70% of your 1RM, and increase weight if possible at every lift. </b>
            </p><p>
            This WOD will be used to see how technique changes as you approach your 1RM. Ideally the weight you ramp up to in the last few minutes will be <em>challenging (~95% of 1RM)</em>.
            </p><p>
            <em>Do not increase weight if your form compromises</em>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3><a id=drain>The Drain</a></h3>
        <p><b>Perform 3 rounds for time of:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>10 cleans at 75% of your 1RM (<a href=#hrCleans>hand release</a> at bottom)</li>
            <li>500m row</li>
            <li>15 burpees</li>
        </ul>Close with 10 cleans at 75% of your 1RM (hand release at bottom)</b>
            </p><p>
            This WOD will test clean technique as fatigue sets in
            </p><p>
            <a id=hrCleans><em>Hand release cleans are necesarry for us to observe a full clean.</em> Wait for the lift status box to turn green before starting your next lift, this should take less than a second after the bar is still.</a>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3><a id=hip>Hip Hop is Dead</a></h3>
        <p><b>Perform 5 rounds for time of:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>5 cleans at 75% of your 1RM (<a href=#hrCleans>hand release</a> at bottom)</li>
            <li>15 Hip Extensions</li>
            <li>10 Toes to Bar</li>
        </ul>Close with 5 cleans at 75% of your 1RM (hand release at bottom)</b>
            </p><p>
            This WOD will test clean technique as hip fatigue sets in
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3><a id=hip>Hand Release Grace</a></h3>
        <p><b>Perform 30 reps for time of 135 lb Clean and Jerk (<a href=#hrCleans>hand release</a> at bottom)</b>
            </p><p>
            This is a classic WOD with the hand release aspect. Focus on technique!
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>

As an alpha, you help shape our development. We love hearing from you!</p>

    <li>
        <h4>What do I get for completing the alpha?</h4>

        <h4>What is a Hand Release Clean and why are we doing them?</h4>
